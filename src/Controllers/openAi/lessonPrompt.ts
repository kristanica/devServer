	- Evaluate the code based on {{instruction}}.   
    - If any part of {{instruction}} is not met, the code is wrong. 
    - Do not recommend to expand the code for testing purposes. 
    - Make sure to point out these: if there are missing tags, example, if there is an opening tag but no closing tag; if semicolon, colon, comma, brackets, and other necessary symbols are missing; check if the usage of the syntaxes are right. 
    - If CSS or JS is empty, treat it as valid only if the lesson/instructions do not require them.
